# Intelligent-Systems-II
In this project, a decision tree is implemented in theory and in practice. A KNN classifier is implemented using LFDA and LMNN metrics.

- Section 1 - Decision Tree (Theory)
    * In this section a decision tree in implemented theoratically.

- Section 2 - Decision Tree (Implementation)
    * In this section a decision tree is implemented for titanic dataset.

- Section 3 - Metric Learning
    * In this section the dataset which is employed is first mapped to a new space using metrics such as LFDA and LMNN.
    * Furthermore, a KNN model is developed for prediction of labels.
